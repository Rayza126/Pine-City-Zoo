        <h3>ELEPHANT</h3>  
        <p>Elephants are large mammal of the family Elephantidae and the order proboscide.</p>
        <p>Two species are traditionally recognised, the African elephant (Loxodonta africana) and the Asian elephant (Elephas maximus).</p>
        <p>Elephants are scattered throughout sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and Southeast Asia.</p> 
        <p>Male African elephants are the largest extant terrestrial animals and can reach a height of 4 m (13 ft) and weigh 7,000 kg (15,000 lb).</p>
        <p>All elephants have several distinctive features the most notable of which is a long trunk or proboscis, used for many purposes, particularly breathing, lifting water and grasping objects.</p> 
        <p>Their incisors grow into tusks, which can serve as weapons and as tools for moving objects and digging. Elephants' large ear flaps help to control their body temperature.</p> 
        <p>Their pillar-like legs can carry their great weight.</p> 
        <p>African elephants have larger ears and concave backs while Asian elephants have smaller ears and convex or level backs.</p>
        <p>Elephants are herbivorous and can be found in different habitats including savannahs, forests, deserts and marshes. They prefer to stay near water.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</h3>
         
        <p>You will find the elephants at pen E22, right next to the amphitheatre.sian elephant.</p>
